How Gemini Watermark Removal Works
Step 1: Understanding Gemini’s Watermark

Gemini applies a semi-transparent watermark using alpha compositing:

watermarked = α × logo + (1 − α) × original


This means the original pixel still exists — it’s just mathematically blended.

Step 2: Reverse Alpha Blending (Our Secret Sauce)

We reverse the formula:

original = (watermarked − α × logo) / (1 − α)


By using pre-captured Gemini watermark alpha maps, we recover the original pixels exactly, without guessing.
